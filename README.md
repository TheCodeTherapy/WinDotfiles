My personal Windows dotfiles.

Written to be used on Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021... because fuck Microsoft with its bloat, ads, and abusive data mining on a fucking PAID operating system. We're not idiots, nor products! You should NEVER pay for an operating system showing ads on a weather widget, nor allow it to collect your data or freely push new software you haven't asked for to your computer.

The only reason to use Windows is when you develop software for Windows users (unfortunately, the vast majority of desktop users), and if you're forced to do so, you should hack it to do it decently.
